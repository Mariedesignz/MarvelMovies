Marvel Movie Database



Introduction This database project is my final project for code Louisville SQL Spring 2021 Cohort. The purpose of this project is to display what I have learned in this course using SQL.

Project Description Marvel Movie DataBase

Marvel movie database is a project for watching Marvel movies. You can list out the movies you want to binge, By rating or runntime.
Issues I ran into with this project are using SQl Server for the first time. Using the syantax to create tables.
What I enjoyed about this project is putting what I have been learning to use and creating a database out of one of my hobbies.

Featured List: 

Group 1: Write a SELECT query that utilizes an ORDER BY clause. 2) Write a SELECT query that filters NULL rows using IS NOT NULL.

Group 2: Write a DML statement that DELETEs a set of rows with a WHERE clause. The values used in the WHERE clause should be a variable.

Group 3: Design a NONCLUSTERED INDEX with ONE KEY COLUMN that improves the performance of one of the above queries.

Instructions for Running: Clone project or open zipfile, Using MySQL Run MarvelProject file. Run the entire file.
